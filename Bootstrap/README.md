Bootstrap - Responsive Web Development
=========

The Bootstrap Book
------------------

Bootstrap is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for building user interface components and websites. If you want to build killer web interfaces and jump on top of trends like responsive sites, then Bootstrap should be at the foundation of your site build. In addition to the responsive framework, Bootstrap offers a suite of jQuery tools like a revolving slideshow, tabbable interface, drop down menus, and custom modal windows. In this book, we'll look into how you can add these tools to your development workflow.
